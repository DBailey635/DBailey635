I am a web and database designer / developer, and a project manager with over 20 yearsâ€™ experience in developing, implementing and administering large websites to attract new customers and maximise income. I enjoy using my design skills to understand the needs of website visitors and software users, and create graceful user interface experiences for them.

My portfolio includes graphic design, multimedia, user interface design, user experience design, web prototyping, copy-writing, technical writing, accessibility and usability design, desktop publishing, photography, fine art and illustration. That may seem like a lot of specialities, but I am often called on to work in obscure projects where I have ample opportunities to learn new skills.

A classically-trained designer, I graduated from the University of Wales with a BA (Hons) in Graphic Arts. I am also a Professional Member of the BCS - The Chartered Institute for IT, a Registered IT Technician, and was formerly a registered PRINCE2 practitioner.

My expertise centres around system development and integrating website designs with Content Management Systems, particularly [Orckestra C1 CMS](https://github.com/Orckestra/C1-CMS-Foundation) (an open-source .NET based CMS), but I have also worked with Orchard and TerminalFour CMSs. Please contact me if you'd like help or advice in this regard.
